		Task:
		1. Add a title to your page (within the <head>) and an actual <h1> title on the page.
		2. Below the h1, add a paragraph that explains what the food is, and why you like it so much.
		3. Add emojis to your second list (the ordered list), so that at least 5 of the lines end with an emoji character. You can find emojis online pretty easily. Download them from your favorite emoji website and then upload them somewhere so you can link to them on your HTML page.
		4. Below your final list, add another paragraph that describes what the dish should look, smell, and taste like when it's all done.

		Extra Credit:
		Below the final paragraph on the page, add a few images of finished versions of your dish so that the reader can see what the final product should look like.

            <!--List items start-->
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter three 9-inch cake rounds. Dust with flour and tap out the excess. 🍚</li><!--Added smiley-->
            <li>Mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand mixer using a low speed until combined. 🍬</li>
            <li>Add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on a medium speed until smooth. This should take just a couple of minutes. ⏰</li>
            <li>Divide batter among the three pans. I found that it took just over 3 cups of the batter to divide it evenly. 🥧</li>
            <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. 🍪</li>
            <li>Cool on wire racks for 15 minutes and then turn out the cakes onto the racks and allow to cool completely. 🍰</li>
            <li>Frost with your favorite frosting and enjoy! 🎂</li>
