    <!--
		Task:
        It's time to compare your recipe to the recipes of others. Find the 5 best recipes for your dish from around the web. Now, add a list to the bottom of your document that links to each of those recipes.

        Extra Credit:
        So far your page is fairly unstructured (just lists, paragraphs and one title). Spruce it up a little by adding section-headings and extra elements to make the recipe more helpful to your readers. Get creative, add any elements you feel would help the user really understand the recipe and the dish itself.

                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter three 9-inch cake rounds. Dust with flour and tap out the excess. üçö</li><!--Added smiley-->
                <li>Mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand mixer using a low speed until combined. üç¨</li>
                <li>Add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on a medium speed until smooth. This should take just a couple of minutes. ‚è∞</li>
                <li>Divide batter among the three pans. I found that it took just over 3 cups of the batter to divide it evenly. ü•ß</li>
                <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. üç™</li>
                <li>Cool on wire racks for 15 minutes and then turn out the cakes onto the racks and allow to cool completely. üç∞</li>
